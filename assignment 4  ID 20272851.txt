/*4. What is difference between COUNT(*), COUNT(col_name), COUNT(DISTINCT(col_name)), COUNT(ALL(col_name))? Explain with examples.*/

/* COUNT(*) is the number of the rows in a table.
This example returns the total number of rows in table emp.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emp; 

  COUNT(*)
----------
        15

 COUNT(col_name) counts the number of not null values in a column.
This example shows that mgr column has 14 not null values. That means in emp table, 14 employees have manager, and 1 do not.

SELECT COUNT(mgr) FROM emp; 
COUNT(MGR)
----------
        14

 
 COUNT(DISTINCT(col_name)) counts the number of unique values in a column and exclude null values.

This example returns the number of unique, notnull values in the mgr column. There are 6 unique,notnull values, indicating 6 managers.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(mgr)) FROM emp;
COUNT(DISTINCT(MGR))
--------------------
                   6

 COUNT(ALL(col_name)) is the same as COUNT(col_name)returns the 
number of notnull values of a column. 

This example returns the number of notnull values in the mgr column. 
For instnace:
SELECT COUNT(ALL(mgr))FROM emp;
COUNT(ALL(MGR))
---------------
             14 */


/*5. Display the employee number, name, salary, and salary increase by 15% expressed as a whole number. Label the column New Salary.*/

FROM emp;
